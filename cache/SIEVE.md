# What Is SIEVE?
- SIEVE is a smart and simple method used in web caches (like in key-value stores or CDNs) to decide: 
- Which items should stay in the cache and which should be thrown out when the cache is full?

## 💡 The Problem SIEVE Solves
- Most web traffic is "one-hit wonders":
    - A new item (like a web page or image) is requested once and then never again. 
    - If we cache all new items equally, the cache fills with junk quickly.

- So we need a way to:
Be careful about keeping new items, and Only keep the items that are repeatedly requested.


## 🚀 How SIEVE Works (Simplified)
1. Only One Queue (FIFO):
   Items are stored in a First-In-First-Out queue (the oldest ones are at the end, new ones at the front).

2. One Extra Bit per Item:
   Each item has 1 flag bit:
   “Has this item been requested again since it was added?”

3. Lazy Promotion:
   When you hit (re-use) an item, you do NOT move it like in LRU.
   Instead, you just flip the bit to say: “Yep, this one was useful!” 
   This is called lazy promotion — only record hits, don’t shuffle things.

4. Eviction Hand (Like CLOCK):
   There's a "hand" (like a pointer) that starts at the tail (oldest items).
   It slowly moves toward the front (head).

5. Eviction Decision:
   When the hand reaches an item:

If the bit = 0 → it means “never reused” → evict it

If the bit = 1 → it means “someone reused it” → keep it, and reset the bit to 0

Then the hand keeps moving.


## 🧪 Why This Is Smart
- New stuff gets evicted fast if it's not reused — this avoids caching junk.
- Old stuff that's reused stays longer, even if we don't shuffle positions.
- It’s simpler than LRU (no reordering), but often gets better results.

## 📊 Why It’s Better
- Better than LRU in many cases
- Even outperforms LFU (Least Frequently Used) on workloads where the most-used content stays popular for a while
- Works well for web traffic, where:
   - Some content gets super popular 
   - But most content is only seen once
