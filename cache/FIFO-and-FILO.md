# First in first out (FIFO)
With this algorithm, the cache behaves like a FIFO queue; it evicts blocks in the order in which they were added,
regardless of how often or how many times they were accessed before.

# Last in first out (LIFO) or First in last out (FILO)
The cache behaves like a stack, and unlike a FIFO queue.
The cache evicts the block added most recently first, regardless of how often or how many times it was accessed before.
