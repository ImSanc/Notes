# Cache replacement policies
- <b>Cache replacement policies (also known as cache replacement algorithms or cache algorithms)</b> are optimizing instructions or algorithms which a computer program or hardware-maintained structure can utilize to manage a cache of information.


# Thereâ€™s a Magic Formula:
 <b>T = m Ã— Tâ‚˜ + Tâ‚• + E</b>

This is a formula for average memory access time. Letâ€™s break it down:

#### What Do These Letters Mean?
 - T = how long it takes on average to get data from memory

 - m = miss ratio â†’ how often we donâ€™t find what we want in the fast memory
(like when you open your toy box and the toy isnâ€™t there)
 
- Tâ‚˜ = how long it takes to go get it from the slow place (like the attic)

- Tâ‚• = how long it takes to check the fast place (your toy box)

- E = extra time that might happen if thereâ€™s waiting (like your brother is using the toy)

 So, the computer first checks the fast memory:

If the thing is there = it's a "hit" = fast

If the thing is not there = it's a "miss" = slow, have to go look in bigger memory

#### ðŸ“¦ Cache Has Two Superpowers:
- Hit ratio â€“ how often it finds things in the fast memory (more is better!)

 - Latency â€“ how fast it can find things (less is better!)
