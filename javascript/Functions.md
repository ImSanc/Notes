## Function Syntax
- In JavaScript, there are two main ways to declare a function. One of which is to use the function keyword.

#### Basic Syntax
The syntax is:

        function f(a, b) {
            const sum = a + b;
            return sum;
        }
        console.log(f(3, 4)); // 7

- In this example, f is the name of the function. (a, b) are the arguments. You can write any logic in the body and finally return a result.
- You are allowed to return nothing, and it will instead implicitly return undefined.

#### Anonymous Function
- You can optionally exclude the name of the function after the function keyword.

          var f = function(a, b) {
          const sum = a + b;
          return sum;
          }
          console.log(f(3, 4)); // 7


#### Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)
- You can create a function and immediately execute it in Javascript.

        const result = (function(a, b) {
            const sum = a + b;
            return sum;
        })(3, 4);
        console.log(result); // 7

- Why would you write code like this? It gives you the opportunity to encapsulate a variable within a new scope.
- For example, another developer can immediately see that sum can't be used anywhere outside the function body.


#### Functions Within Functions
- A powerful feature of JavaScript is you can actually create functions within other functions and even return them!


        function createFunction() {
            function f(a, b) {
                const sum = a + b;
                return sum;
            }
            return f;
        }
        const f = createFunction();
        console.log(f(3, 4)); // 7

In this example, createFunction() returns a new function. Then that function can be used as normal.


#### Function Hoisting
- JavaScript has a feature called hoisting where a function can sometimes be used before it is initialized.
  - You can only do this if you declare functions with the function syntax.

        function createFunction() {
                return f;   //We call it before intializing 
            function f(a, b) {
                const sum = a + b;
                return sum;
            }
        }
        const f = createFunction();
        console.log(f(3, 4)); // 7
- In this example, the function is returned before it is initialized.
- Although it is valid syntax, it is sometimes considered bad practice as it can reduce readability.


#### Closures
- An important topic in JavaScript is the concept of closures.
- When a function is created, it has access to a reference to all the variables declared around it, also known as it's lexical environment.
- The combination of the function and its enviroment is called a closure. This is a powerful and often used feature of the language.

        function createAdder(a) {
            function f(b) {
                const sum = a + b;
                return sum;
            }
            return f;
        }
        const f = createAdder(3);
        console.log(f(4)); // 7
- In this example, createAdder passes the first parameter a and the inner function has access to it.
- This way, createAdder serves as a factory of new functions, with each returned function having different behavior.

#### Arrow Syntax
- The other common way to declare functions is with arrow syntax. In fact, on many projects, it is the preferred syntax.

Basic Syntax:

        const f = (a, b) => {
            const sum = a + b;
            return sum;
        };
        console.log(f(3, 4)); // 7
- In this example, f is the name of the function. (a, b) are the arguments. You can write any logic in the body and finally return a result.
- You are allowed to return nothing, and it will instead implicitly return undefined.


#### Omit Return
- If you can write the code in a single line, you can omit the return keyword. This can result in very short code.

        const f = (a, b) => a + b;
        console.log(f(3, 4)); // 7

#### Differences
There are 3 major differences between arrow syntax and function syntax.

- More minimalistic syntax. This is especially true for anonymous functions and single-line functions.
For this reason, this way is generally preferred when passing short anonymous functions to other functions.

- No automatic hoisting. You are only allowed to use the function after it was declared.
This is generally considered a good thing for readability.

- Can't be bound to this, super, and arguments or be used as a constructor.
These are all complex topics in themselves but the basic takeaway should be that arrow functions are simpler in their feature set.


#### Rest Arguments
- You can use rest syntax to access all the passed arguments as an array.
- This isn't necessary for this problem, but it will be a critical concept for many problems.
- Basic Syntax
  - The syntax is:

        function f(...args) {
        const sum = args[0] + args[1];
        return sum;
        }
        console.log(f(3, 4)); // 7
- In this example the variable args is [3, 4].


### Why
- It may not be immediately obvious why you would use this syntax because you can always just pass an array and get the same result.
- The primary use-case is for creating generic factory functions that accept any function as input and return a new version of the function with some specific modification.
  - By the way, a function that accepts a function and/or returns a function is called a higher-order function, and they are very common in JavaScript.
    - Example : 

            function log(inputFunction) {
                return function(...args) {
                    console.log("Input", args);
                    const result = inputFunction(...args);
                    console.log("Output", result);
                    return result;
              }
            }
            const f = log((a, b) => a + b);
            f(1, 2); // Logs: Input [1, 2] Output 3
