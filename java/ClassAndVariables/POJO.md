# POJO (Plain Old Java Object)

- A plain old Java object (whose acronym is POJO) is a class that generally only has instance fields.
- It's used to house data and pass data between functional classes.
- It usually has no other, or very few methods, other than getters and setters for the instance fields.
- Many database frameworks use POJO's to read data from, or to write data to databases, files or streams.


## Example of POJO's

- A POJO also might be called a bean or a JavaBean. 
- A JavaBean is just a POJO with some extra rules applied to it. 
- A POJO is sometimes called an Entity because it mirrors database entities.  
- Another acronym is DTO for Data Transfer Object.
- It's a description of an object that can be modeled as just data.
