# Annotations
- Annotations are a type of metadata.
- Metadata is a way to formally describe additional information about our code.
- Annotations are more structured and have more meaning than comments.
- This is because they can be used by the compiler or other types of pre-processing functions, to get information about the code.
- Metadata doesn't affect how the code runs so this code will still run with or without the annotation.


## @Override annotation / Overridden method
- An overridden method is not the same thing as an overloaded method.
- An overridden method is a special method in Java that other classes can implement if they use a specified method signature.
