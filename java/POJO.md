# POJO (Plain Old Java Object)

- A plain old Java object (whose acronym is POJO) is a class that generally only has instance fields.
- It's used to house data and pass data between functional classes.
- It usually has no other, or very few methods, other than getters and setters for the instance fields.
- Many database frameworks use POJO's to read data from, or to write data to databases, files or streams.
