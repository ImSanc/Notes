# OOP (Object-Oriented programming)

- OOP is a way to model real-world objects as software objects which contains both data and code.
- OOP is acronym for Object-Oriented programming.
- Sometimes it is called Class-Based programming

## Class-based programming
- It starts with classes which becomes the blueprints for objects 

- Modelling real-world objects as software objects is a fundamental part of Object-oriented programming.
- A software objects stores its state in fields. which can also be called variables or attributes.
- Objects expose their behaviour with methods.
### Class
- Class is like template or blueprint for creating objects.
- The class describes the data (fields), and the behavior (methods), that are relevant to the real-world object we want to describe
- These are called class members.
- A class member can be a field or a method, or some other type of dependent element.
- If a field is static, there is only one copy in memory, and this value is associated with the class or template itself.

- If a field is not static, it's called an instance field, and each object may have a different value stored for this field.
- A static method can't be dependent on any one object's state, so it can't reference any instance members.
- In other words, any method that operates on instance fields needs to be non-static.

### Organizing classes
- Classes can be organized into logical groupings which are called packages. 
- You declare a package name in the class using the package statement.
- If you don't declare a package, the class implicitly belongs to the default package.


### Access modifiers for the class

- A class is said to be a top-level class if it is defined in the source code file and not enclosed in the code block of another class, type, or method.
- A top-level class has only two valid access modifier options: public or none.

### Encapsulation 
- Encapsulation in Object-Oriented Programming usually has two meanings.
- One is the bundling of behavior and attributes on a single object.
- The other is the practice of hiding fields and some methods from public access


### Getter and setters 
- A Getter is the method on a class that retrieves the value of  private field and return it.
- A Setter is a method on a class that sets the value of a private field
- The purpose of these methods are to protect and control access to private fields

### This
- <b>this</b> is the special keyword in java.
- What it really refers to is the instance that was created when the object was initiated.
- So, <b>this</b> is a special reference name for the object or instance , which it can use to describe itself.
- we can use <b> this </b> to access fields on the class.


## Constructor 
- A <b> Constructor </b> is used in creation of the object.
- It is a special type of code block that has a specific name and parameters, much like method
- It has the same name as a class itself, it doesn't return any value.
- You never include a return type from a constructor , not even void.
- You can , you should , specify an appropriate access modifier to control who should be able to create new instances of the class, using this constructor.


    public class Account {  // this is class declaration
    
        public Account(){ // this is constructor declaration1
            // Constructor code is to be executed as the object is created. 
        }
    }

### Default constructor
- default constructor is always generated by java , we cannot see the implicit code , but it is in bit code.
- If a class has no constructor declaration ,then the default constructor is implicitly declared.
- This constructor doesn't have any argument and often called no-args constructor.
- If a class has any other constructor declaration, then a default constructor is not implicitly declared.


### constructor overloading
- It is declaring multiple constructor with different parameters.
- The numbers of the parameter can be different between constructor.
- Or if same between two constructor , their types, or order of the types must differ.


### Constructor chaining with this()
- Constructor chaining is when a explicitly calls another overloaded constructor.
-  You can only use constructor chaining within the constructor.
- You must use the special statement <b>this() </b> to execute another constructor, passing it arguments if required.
- And <b> this() </b> must be the first executable statement if it's used from another constructor


        public Account() {
            this("1234" , 3.50, "default name" , "default address " , "default phone" );
            //here this calls the constructor with these default values are parameter
        }

        // This would be called from the above default constructor
        public Account(String number, double balance , String customerName , String email , String phone) {
                this.number = number;
                .....
        }
